# AR-Examples
The examples from [Lee Stemkoski](https://github.com/stemkoski/AR-Examples) was forked and a few examples are added.
* for using these examples, print out the [markers](markers/Marker_Printout_AR_demo.pdf) and
* switch on the WebCam and let browser to access the WebCam.
* place the marker mentioned in the [demo page](https://niebert.github.io/AR-Examples) in front of the camera and move the markers
* in some AR examples multiple markers can be used and different objects can be places
* also [360-degree (equirectangular) images](https://www.github.com/niebert/HuginSample) are used to and you could use e.g. the [hiro-marker](markers/Marker_Printout_AR_demo.pdf) to look around

* Use Hiro-Marker as print out
* Start [Web-Demo - Spinosaurus on AR-Marker - "Hiro"](https://niebert.github.io/AR-Examples/spinosaurus_hiro_ar.html)
* Allow camera to record Hiro-Marker in Webcam.
* Dinosaur will be placed on Hiro-Marker in Cameraimage
